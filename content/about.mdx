👋 Hey, I'm **Tim**. I'm an **Android** and **Next.js** developer based in the 🌉 **San-Francisco Bay Area**.

I grew up **🏇herding** livestock in a small part of 🇲🇳 **Mongolia.**

I studied 👨‍🎓 **Computer Science** at the University of Applied Sciences of 🇩🇪 **Mittweida** and did an internship at 🚘 **Daimler.**

I love working with **Kotlin** and **Compose** for **Android** apps and **TypeScript** with **TailwindCSS** for **Next.js** projects.

Since 2019, I’ve been building **Android** and **Next.js** apps — **3 mobile apps** on Google Play and **5 web apps** launched.

When I’m not 🧑‍💻 **coding**, I love going for 🏃 **runs**.

Please feel free to 🎉 **reach out** and let"s build something 🚀 **cool!**
