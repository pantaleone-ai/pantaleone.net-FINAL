I'm a **Frontend** developer based in the 🌉 **San-Francisco Bay Area**.

I grew up **🏇herding** livestock in a small part of 🇲🇳 **Mongolia.**

I studied 👨‍🎓 **Computer Science** at the University of Applied Sciences of 🇩🇪 **Mittweida** and did an internship at 🚘 **Daimler.**

I love working with **Next.js**, **React**, and **TypeScript** for web projects, styling with **TailwindCSS**, and developing **Android** apps using **Kotlin** and **Jetpack Compose**.

Since 2019, I’ve developed **two Android apps** available on **Google Play** and launched **three web apps** using **Next.js**.

When I’m not 🧑‍💻 **coding**, I love going for 🏃 **runs**.

Please feel free to 🎉 **[reach out](/contact)** and let’s build something 🚀 **cool!**
