I'm a **Frontend Developer** based in 🇺🇸 San Francisco Bay Area.

I grew up 🏇 herding livestock in a small part of 🇲🇳 Mongolia.

I studied 👨‍🎓 Computer Science at the **University of Applied Sciences Mittweida** in 🇩🇪 Germany and interned at 🚘 Daimler.

I love working with **Next.js, React, and TypeScript** for web projects, styling with **Tailwind CSS**, and developing **Android apps** with Kotlin and Jetpack Compose.

Since 2019, I’ve built **two Android apps** available on Google Play and launched **three web apps** using Next.js.

When I’m not 🧑‍💻 coding, I enjoy 🏃 running.

Feel free to 🎉 **reach out**—let’s build something 🚀 cool!
