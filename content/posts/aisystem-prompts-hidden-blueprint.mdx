# Leaked System Prompts - They're out in the wild now - here's an overview.

## Key Points
- System prompts can reveal AI design, with common elements like AI identity, knowledge cutoffs, and ethical guidelines.  This is important if we want to drive the highest quality output.
- Differences across models show unique approaches, such as xAI's Grok naming misinformation spreaders like Elon Musk as well as differences in prompt formatting and tool calling.
- The evidence leans toward prompts evolving over time, integrating features like image generation and refining ethics.
- There is controversy around leaked prompts posing security risks, potentially enabling manipulation and impacting AI trust, sparking debates on transparency versus security.  We did not leak the prompts.  We are analyzing them for the broadest benefit to AI users.

## Introduction
**System prompts are the hidden blueprints** that dictate how AI models think and/or how ChatGPT, Claude, or Grok—interact with users. They define the AI’s identity, capabilities, and boundaries, and are usually kept under wraps by their creators. However, the GitHub repository [leaked-system-prompts](https://github.com/pantaleone-ai/leaked-system-prompts) by pantaleone-ai and others has pulled back the curtain, compiling leaked prompts from various AI models spanning December 2022 to March 2025. Here we dive into the most intriguing aspects of these prompts, drawing from detailed analysis to uncover what makes them so compelling and what they reveal about the AI landscape.

## A Peek Inside the Repository
The "leaked-system-prompts" repository is a treasure trove of **over 60 Markdown files**, each documenting system prompts for models from giants like OpenAI, Anthropic, Google, Microsoft, and xAI. Files are neatly labeled by model and leak date—e.g., openai-chatgpt_20221201.md or xAI-grok3_20250223.md—offering a timeline of AI evolution.

# The Most Interesting Aspects of System Prompts

## 1. Common Threads That Tie AI Together
Across the board, system prompts share some universal traits that shape AI behavior:

- **Identity and Origin**: Every prompt introduces the AI and its creator. For instance, OpenAI’s ChatGPT (December 1, 2022) declares, "Assistant is a large language model trained by OpenAI" [[source](https://github.com/pantaleone-ai/leaked-system-prompts/blob/main/openai-chatgpt_20221201.md)], while Anthropic’s Claude (March 6, 2024) says, "The assistant is Claude, created by Anthropic" [[source](https://github.com/jujumilk3/leaked-system-prompts/blob/main/anthropic-claude-sonnet-3_20240306.md)].
- **Knowledge Cutoffs**: Most specify a training data cutoff—ChatGPT’s early version stops at 2021, while Claude’s Sonnet-3 goes to August 2023—limiting their view of the world.
- **Response Style**: Instructions often dictate brevity for simple queries and depth for complex ones, with some, like Claude, mandating Markdown for coding answers.
- **Ethical Guardrails**: Avoiding harm, bias, or illegal activities is a staple, reflecting a shared commitment to responsible AI.

**Why It’s Interesting**: These commonalities reveal a **standardized recipe for conversational AI, balancing utility with safety**. It’s like peering into the DNA of AI design—consistent yet adaptable.

## 2. Unique Flavors: What Sets Models Apart
While there’s overlap, the differences are where things get interasting:

- **AI’s Grok 3 Takes a Stand**: Unlike the neutral tone of most models, Grok 3 (February 23, 2025) explicitly names figures like Elon Musk as misinformation spreaders, suggesting a bold approach to truth-telling that’s rare among AIs [[source](https://medium.com/@Michael_Ram/leaked-system-prompts-from-xais-grok-3-df226e9f6f19)]. This specificity stands out against ChatGPT’s or Claude’s broader, less personal ethical guidelines.
- **OpenAI’s Multimodal Leap**: By May 2024, ChatGPT4o integrates image generation via DALL-E, with rules like avoiding post-1912 artist styles (e.g., no Picasso) and substituting with descriptive adjectives [[source](https://github.com/jujumilk3/leaked-system-prompts/blob/main/openai-chatgpt4o_20240520.md)]. This isn’t seen in earlier prompts or Anthropic’s offerings.
- **Anthropic’s Social Sensitivity**: Claude’s Opus version (March 6, 2024) includes instructions to assist with widely held views—even if it disagrees—followed by broader context, and avoids stereotyping majority groups [[source](https://github.com/jujumilk3/leaked-system-prompts/blob/main/anthropic-claude-opus_20240306.md)].

**Why It’s Interesting**: These quirks highlight how companies imprint their philosophies onto AI. Grok’s naming names feels rebellious, OpenAI’s image rules show practical innovation, and Claude’s nuance reflects a careful dance around social issues. It’s a window into their priorities—truth, utility, or harmony.  The point is **we** should have input into these configurations - it shouldnt be set by some AI overlords!

## 3. Evolution Over Time: AI Grows Up
The repository’s timeline shows prompts aren’t static — they evolve:

- **Knowledge Updates**: ChatGPT’s cutoff moves from 2021 (2022 leak) to October 2023 (2024 leak), while Claude’s shifts from August 2023 to later refinements across versions (2.0 to 3.7).
- **New Features**: ChatGPT4o’s image generation (May 2024) marks a leap from text-only roots, a feature absent in 2022’s prompt. This multimodal shift is a game-changer for user interaction.
- **Refined Ethics**: Anthropic’s Claude adds layers over time—e.g., handling views and stereotyping by March 2024—suggesting responses to user feedback or societal pressures.

**Why It’s Interesting**: Watching prompts mature is like tracking AI’s coming-of-age story. Each update reflects technological leaps and a tighter grip on ethics, showing how fast this field moves and adapts - again, all things we as users should have a say in.

## 4. The Double-Edged Sword: Security and Ethics
Leaked prompts aren’t just cool—they’re controversial:

- **Security Risks**: Exposed prompts can be exploited for adversarial attacks, manipulating AI behavior or extracting sensitive info [[source](https://www.sydelabs.ai/blog/why-system-prompt-leaks-are-bad)]. Imagine tweaking inputs to bypass Grok’s misinformation filters or ChatGPT’s image rules.
- **Trust at Stake**: Such leaks could erode user confidence, as noted in discussions on prompt leaking risks [[source](https://learnprompting.org/docs/prompt_hacking/leaking)]. If AI can be gamed, how reliable is it?
- **Transparency Debate**: Anthropic bucks the trend by publishing prompts for openness [[source](https://techcrunch.com/2024/08/26/anthropic-publishes-the-system-prompt-that-makes-claude-tick/)], while others guard theirs for safety. It’s a tug-of-war between insight and protection.

**Why It’s Interesting**: This tension is the most gripping part. Leaks turn a technical detail into a high-stakes drama—security versus transparency, with real-world fallout. It’s not just code; it’s trust, ethics, and power.  We're not breaking any laws here; we're simply reporting on the news and these system prompt leaks are incredibly newsworthy.

## Unexpected Gem: Multimodal Magic
One surprise stands out: **ChatGPT4o’s image generation rules**. Beyond text, it weaves in visual creativity with strict policies—no modern artists, just adjectives and eras. This unexpected pivot to multimodal AI hints at a future where AI isn’t just a chatbot but a full sensory assistant.

## Conclusion
The "leaked-system-prompts" repository is more than a collection — it’s a lens into AI’s inner workings. Common threads show a shared foundation, unique differences reveal company character, evolution tracks progress, and security debates expose vulnerabilities. From Grok’s bold naming to ChatGPT’s visual flair, these prompts are a fascinating mix of tech, ethics, and intrigue. As AI advances, understanding these instructions will be key to navigating its potential and pitfalls.

Analyze, evaluate and utilize in your day-to-day.
