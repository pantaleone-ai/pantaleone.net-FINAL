    "Hey, I’m Tim, an Android developer in the San Francisco Bay Area. I grew up herding livestock in a small part of Mongolia.",
    "I love working with Kotlin and Jetpack Compose for Android apps and Next.js with Tailwind CSS for web projects. Lately, I’ve been experimenting with turning Next.js apps into Android apps using Kotlin—it’s been a fun challenge!",
    "I studied Computer Science at the University of Applied Sciences of Mittweida and did an internship at Daimler.",
    "I’ve been developing Android apps since 2017 and have published three apps on the Google Play Store.",
    "When I’m not coding, I love going for runs. I’m always open to collaborating, so feel free to reach out—let’s build something cool!",
